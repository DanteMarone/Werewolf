## ü§ñ About this Project

This project was co-created with the assistance of AI tools, **Gemini** and **Jules**. The goal was to create a compelling, shareable, and fun single-page application that showcases the power of modern AI and web technologies.

The decision to keep it as a single-file SPA was intentional to ensure maximum portability and ease of use. Anyone can download the `index.html` file, add their API key, and start playing immediately.
